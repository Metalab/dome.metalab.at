        <h2>A house is nice, but it can't go on vacation with you.</h2>
        <div class="teaser"> Metalab Dome is built from the ground up to be portable. Unlike a tent, it provides enough
            space for all activities where you usually want to have a house. </div>
        <div class="explanation"> Metalab Dome is designed to fit into a compact transporter. It goes wherever you go.
            With its full aluminium design, transport weight is not an issue. </div>

        <div class="teaser"> Metalab Dome only needs a few steps to assemble. It comes with detailed instructions
            thoroughly tested in the field. </div>
        <div class="explanation"> Metalab Dome underwent a forces simulation to make sure that people can climb on it
            during construction. A ladder is recommended, but not required. </div>
